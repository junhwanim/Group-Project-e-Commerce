# Kick-off Meeting

- **Housekeeping**
  - Begin by setting times for meetings over the next week.
    - These meetings, or _stand-ups_ as they are commonly called, should occur at least once a day. We do recommend twice a day, given the tight deadline.
    - They can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Expect meetings to be longer at the beginning of the project as everyone is still trying to understand what it is they have to do.
- **Understand**
  - Read the [PROJECT guidelines](PROJECT.md)
  - what are we building?
  - what are the requirements?
  - Is the project clear?
  - Do we have questions for the stakeholders? _If so, book some time with a TC/PM, or your instructor._
- **Brainstorming**
  - Take a look at the data
    - What do we have to show?
    - How ca nwe make the most of the provided data?
  - Ideas for store functionality
    - What do we want users to be able to do?
  - Look and feel
    - Any real-life e-comm sites that inspires us?
- **Division of labor**
  - Begin to break down the project into tasks, and then into subtasks, and maybe even subsubtasks. \_Breaking things down into the smallest task possible will improve the collaborative effort of each individual team member.
  - Move all tasks to a board of some kind. [Trello](https://trello.com) would be the easiest to figure out and use.
  - Assign tasks
    - This is much more open. Discuss with your team to figure out how best to proceed. If you are unsure, speak with a TC or your instructor.
    - Possible questions (relevance will depend on group size)...
      - Who is most excited about a particular task?
      - Do we need a manager for a particular group of tasks? i.e. BE, FE.
      - Who will coordinate between the BE and FE.
- **TEAM Name**
  - Once you've had a chance to discuss, it might be fun to come up with a team name that is better than "Team #".
